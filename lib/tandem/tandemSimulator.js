/**
 * Creates a new "simulator" for Tandem insulin pump data. The simulator has methods for events like
 *
 * cbg(), smbg(), basal(), bolus(), settingsChange(), etc.
 *
 * This simulator exists as an abstraction over the Tidepool APIs. It was written to simplify the conversion
 * of static, "retrospective" audit logs from devices into events understood by the Tidepool platform.
 *
 * On the input side, you have events extracted from a Tandem insulin pump. They should be delivered to the simulator
 * in time order.
 *
 * Once all input activities are collected, the simulator will have accumulated events that the Tidepool Platform
 * will understand into a local "events" array.  You can retrieve the events by calling `getEvents()`
 *
 * @param config
 * @returns {*}
